# Task-Tracker

https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

A simple command-line task tracker application written in Go. It allows users to add, update, list, and delete tasks, with each task having a unique ID, description, status (todo, in-progress, done), and timestamps for creation and last update. The tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence.
